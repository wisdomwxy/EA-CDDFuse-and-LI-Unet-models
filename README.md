# EA-CDDFuse-and-LI-Unet-models
The relevant reproduction codes of the multimodal image fusion model EA-CDDFuse and the semantic segmentation model LI-Unet. Among them, the EA-CDDFuse model accepts visible light images and near-infrared images and generates fused images. Then, the LI-Unet model performs semantic segmentation based on the fused images.
